# clustering-the-stock-market
Goal: Use 5 years of quarterly stock data across the Dow Jones to establish visual filters and informative clusters.
- Doing so can highlight companies that are in growth phases, decline phases, or just kinda stagnant. 
- Using financial ratios combined with clustering, we can assess patterns between stocks in a convenient way. 

The model does not implement time series techniques as I wanted to achieve a generic overview of company characteristics.
